#### Add --embedded-language-formatting={auto,off} option ([#7875](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7875) by [@bakkot](https://github.com/bakkot))

When Prettier identifies cases where it looks like you've placed some code it knows how to format within a string in another file, like in a tagged template in JavaScript with a tag named `html` or in code blocks in Markdown, it will by default try to format that code.

Sometimes this behavior is undesirable, since it can change the behavior of your code. This option allows you to switch between the default behavior (`auto`) and disabling this feature entirely (`off`). It applies to all languages where Prettier recognizes embedded code, not just JavaScript.

```js
// Input

I am expecting this to come out exactly like it went in.
`;

// using --embedded-language-formatting=auto (or omitting this option)
html`
  <p>
    I am expecting this to come out exactly like it went in.
  </p>

// using --embedded-language-formatting=off
